<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>The CS Tutoring Center addresses two issues affecting the computer science field: (1) high attrition rates in lower-division computer science courses, and (2) the low percentage of female computer science students. Specifically, the center provides extra support through peer tutoring and workshops for students in lower-division computer science courses.
  <!-- , and coordinates with the <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/~cswomen/">Women in Computer Science</a> group to help support and encourage female computer science students.</p> -->

<h2>Services</h2>

<p>The services provided by the CS Tutoring Center include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Holding regular tutoring sessions in the evenings for computer science students</li>

    <li>Helping struggling students, including setting up special tutoring sessions as needed</li>

    <li>Helping with in-class labs for lower-division computer science courses</li>

    <li>Coordinating teacher assistant orientations and periodic meetings</li>

    <!-- <li>Coordinating with the <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/~cswomen/">Women in Computer Science</a> group to hold special tutoring hours and social events</li> -->

    <li>Coordinating community-building and social events, such as speakers, field trips, pizza nights, and contests</li>

    <li>Maintaining the CS Tutoring Center website and calendar</li>

    <li>Facilitating outreach via social networking</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, tutors coordinate with professors of lower-division courses to find out what topics students are struggling with, setup special tutoring sessions before exams, and help with in-class lab exercises.</p>

<h2>Tutors</h2>

<p>Applications for tutors are solicited in the Spring. Ideally, applicants should have already taken the lower-division computer science courses at the University of San Francisco, and already have experience as a teacher assistant.</p>

<!-- <p>Selected applicants will receive a <strong>Outstanding CS Student-Teachers Award</strong> and  -->
  <p>A tutoring position with the CS Tutoring Center that pays a higher rate than most teacher assistant positions. Oversight and mentoring is provided by a faculty sponsor.</p>

<p>See the <a href="{{ site.url }}">Home</a> page for announcements about the application process, and the <a href="{{ site.url }}/tutors/">Tutors</a> page for current and past tutors.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The CS Tutoring Center was launched in Spring 2013 by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wolberd/">Professor David Wolber</a>, thanks to a grant from Craig Conway. The funding provided allows us to attract the best students into tutoring positions by paying a higher rate than most teaching assistantships, and supports various social events and workshops sponsored by the CS Tutoring Center.</p>
