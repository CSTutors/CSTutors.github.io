<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Before you get started, make sure you know your <a href="{% post_url 2013-07-02-about-cs-accounts %}">CS account</a> username and password.</p>

<p>If you are already familiar with SSH, the basic steps to login remotely are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Use SSH to log into our gateway <code>stargate.cs.usfca.edu</code> using your CS account username and password.</p></li>

    <li><p>Run <code>rusers -a</code> on the command-line to see which lab machines are available.</p></li>

    <li><p>Use SSH to log into one of the lab machines from the gateway using your CS account username and password.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following sections detail how to SSH using either Windows or Mac. Either way, make sure you look at the <strong><a href="#lab">SSH into Lab Computers</a></strong> section near the bottom for what you need to do once you have logged in for the first time.</p>

<h2><a name="windows"></a>SSH on Windows</h2>

<p class="muted text-center"><small><em>See <a href="#mac">SSH on Mac OSX</a> if you are using Mac OSX instead of Windows.</em></small></p>

<p>If you are using Windows, you should first download and install <strong>PuTTY</strong> at <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>. Once installed, open up PuTTy. Enter <code>stargate.cs.usfca.edu</code> as the Host Name:</p>

{% assign thumbnail="remote-putty-config.png" %}
{% include thumbnail.html %}

<p>Click the "Open" button. You may receive a warning (see below).</p>

{% assign thumbnail="remote-putty-alert.png" %}
{% include thumbnail.html %}

<p>Go ahead and click "Accept". When prompted, enter your username and password. <span class="text-error">You will not see the text you type when entering your password.</span> (This prevents someone from looking over your shoulder and seeing your password.)</p>

{% assign thumbnail="remote-putty-password.png" %}
{% include thumbnail.html %}

<p>Once you have successfully logged in, you will see a welcome message similar to the following:</p>

{% assign thumbnail="remote-putty-welcome.png" %}
{% include thumbnail.html %}

<p>Read the message! <span class="text-error">You should not start working on this machine.</span> Skip to the section <strong><a href="#lab">SSH into Lab Computers</a></strong> below for how to log into one of the lab computers.</p>

<h2>SSH on Mac OSX</h2>

<p>You should not need to install anything special to start using SSH. Open up a Terminal window and enter the following command (replacing <code>test</code> with your username):</p>

<pre>
ssh test@stargate.cs.usfca.edu
</pre>

<p>For example, my username is <code>sjengle</code> so my Terminal window looks as follows:</p>

{% assign thumbnail="remote-mac-ssh.png" %}
{% include thumbnail.html %}

<p>When prompted, enter your username and password. <span class="text-error">You will not see the text you type when entering your password.</span> (This prevents someone from looking over your shoulder and seeing your password.)</p>

<p>Once you have successfully logged in, you will see a welcome message similar to the following:</p>

{% assign thumbnail="remote-mac-welcome.png" %}
{% include thumbnail.html %}

<p>Read the message! <span class="text-error">You should not start working on this machine.</span> Read on to the section <strong><a href="#lab">SSH into Lab Computers</a></strong> below for how to log into one of the lab computers.</p>

<h2>SSH into Lab Computers</h2>

<p>For security reasons, our lab computers are not directly accessible from the Internet. This may be a tad confusing, but what you have done so far is login remotely to our gateway server named <code>stargate.cs.usfca.edu</code>. <span class="text-error">THIS IS NOT A LAB COMPUTER.</span> Please do not use it to work on your homework and projects.</p>

<p>What you must do next is login to a lab computer <em>from</em> our gateway server. You should be at the part where you see a welcome message, no matter whether you are using Windows or Mac OSX. The following screenshots are using Mac OSX, but the text displayed will be similar on Windows and PuTTY.</p>

<p>Next, you need to choose which lab machine to SSH into next. You do not want to choose a machine that another student is already using, since it may be slow. To see which machines are up and have no remote users, run <code>rusers -a</code> as instructed in the welcome message. You will see something similar to this:</p>

{% assign thumbnail="remote-mac-rusers.png" %}
{% include thumbnail.html %}

<p>Computer names will always be <code>hrnAAABB</code> where <code>AAA</code> is the room (235 or 530) and <code>BB</code> is the machine number. In the image above, <code>hrn23501</code> and <code>hrn23502</code> have no users, and <code>hrn23503</code> does not show up indicating it is offline. There is one user test logged into <code>hrn23505</code> and two users <code>test</code> and <code>sjengle</code> are logged into <code>hrn53002</code>.</p>

<p>Choose a machine with no remote users logged in and ssh into that machine. For example, we can run the command <code>ssh hrn23501</code> to ssh into that machine:</p>

{% assign thumbnail="remote-mac-labssh.png" %}
{% include thumbnail.html %}

<p>Enter your password when prompted. At this point, you are ready to start working on the lab computers remotely.</p>
