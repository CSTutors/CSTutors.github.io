<h2>CS Social: Bad Movie Night</h2>

<p>Join us Wednesday, April 23rd in HR 235 for bad movie night! Enjoy hilariously bad movies commentated by the creators of Myster Science Theater 3000.  Free hot dogs, popcorn, and candy will be provided!</p>

<p><strong>We need your help!</strong> Vote for the movie you would like to see <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SvsKRjj1_Vj_mK9-WWGu2tp-5QM_6PrpiKyomXQL9JQ/viewform">here</a> and you can be entered in to our raffle. Here is a quick summary of the potential feature films:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan</strong><br>
		<p>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is commonly regarded as the most fun and exciting installment of the film franchise. Or so I'm told</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Plan 9 From Outter Space</strong>
	<p>There have been many, many Plan 9s all throughout history, some of them more successful than others, all of them terrestrial - it took a man with the vision of Ed Wood to show us the very real horrors of a Plan 9 from Outer Space! </p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Firewall</strong><p>The thrilling world of banking explodes across the silver screen! Harrison Ford is a bank security manager who gets more than he bargained for</p></li>
	<li><strong>Battlefield Earth</strong><p>In the year 3000 man is an endangered species, enslaved, severely unshowered, beholden to a cruel alien race fond of dreadlocks and really impractical boots.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>See you at the movies!</p>
