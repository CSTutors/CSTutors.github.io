<h2>Course Registration <a name="registration"></a></h2>

<dl>

    <dt>How do I register for graduate courses?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>You may register for graduate courses online in USF Connect. See <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/registration/onlineregistration/">this page</a> for instructions. If you run into any holds that prevent you from registering for graduate courses, please <a href="#contact">contact the graduate adviser</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I register for undergraduate courses?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Since most of our undergraduate courses have prerequisite requirements, you will be unable to register for these courses the same way as graduate courses. There are two options for registering for undergraduate courses:

            <ol>
                <li><p>You can contact the instructor of the class and ask to have your prerequisite requirement waived in USF Connect. Make sure you include your CWID/student ID number. The instructor can waive the prerequisite by logging into Banner, clicking the "Faculty Services" tab, and selecting "Registration Overrides".</p>

                <p><strong class="text-danger">You must still enroll in the course.</strong> This process only waives the prerequisite requirement in the system, and does not actually register you in the course. Once the instructor confirms the requirement has been waived, you must still register for the course in USF Connect (see above).</p></li>

                <li><p>You may fill out an <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/onestopforms/">Registration Add/Drop Form</a> (under the "Records and Registration" category). You must get the graduate adviser to sign the form, and then drop it off at the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/onestop/">One Stop</a> office.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <p class="text-muted">Note that if you attempt to register for a course after the first week of class, you will need additional signatures to complete the registration process.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Who do I contact if I am having problems registering for courses?</dt>

    <dd><p>You should <a href="#contact">contact the graduate adviser</a>.</p></dd>

<h2>Foundational Requirements <a name="foundational"></a></h2>

<dl>
    <dt>What are foundational requirements?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>These are requirements you must take in addition to the requirements for the MSCS or MSWS degrees. These are courses that provide the foundation necessary for being successful in graduate-level courses in computer science.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that if you have more than 2 foundational requirements, you may not be able to complete your degree in 2 years.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I know if I have foundational requirements?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Foundational requirements are included on your offer letter. If you are unable to find your offer letter, please <a href="#contact">contact the graduate adviser</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>When should I start satisfying my foundational requirements?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>You should start satisfying your foundational requirements right away, as you generally need the skills taught in these courses for the other graduate-level courses. However, many foundational courses (except for CS 212 Software Development) may be full by the time you arrive at USF. As such, most students start taking foundational requirements during their second semester.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How many foundational requirements may be used as electives?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Only 2 foundational requirements may be used as electives. For example, if you have 4 foundational requirements, only 2 of those courses may be counted as electives. As such, you may need additional time to complete the Master's degree.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Do foundational requirements need to be taken at USF?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>No, you may take these requirements at another reputable university if you wish. Please <a href="#contact">contact the graduate adviser</a> to get approval before enrolling in courses at another institution.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I test out of the foundational requirements?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>No, for the most part you may not test out of the foundational requirements. The only exception is CS 212 Software Development.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>What do I do if I have an English course requirement?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>You must take 4 units of English as a Second Language (ESL) courses. Generally, you can take these courses in addition to two CS courses. See the <a href="http://usfca.edu/esl/">ESL Department</a> for a list of courses.</p>
