Students on academic probation who fail to raise their cumulative grade point average to 3.0 by the time they have completed the next six (6) credit hours of graduate work are subject to disqualification from the program.

 What is the minimum number of courses I should take?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>To be considered a full-time student, graduate students need 6+ credit hours and undergraduate students need 12+ credit hours. Since most courses are 4 units each, this works out to a minimum of 2 graduate courses or 3 undergraduate courses a semester. See the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/gradstudent/">General Catalog</a> for details.</p>
    </dd>

    
    <dt><a name="program_maximum" class="badge" href="#program_maximum">Q</a>&nbsp;
 What is the maximum number of courses I should take?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Most semesters you should take 2 graduate classes at once, although there often be at least one semester you must take 3 classes to finish within 2 years.</p>

        <p>For an undergraduate course, students are expected to spend a <strong>minimum</strong> of 2 hours outside of class for every 1 credit hour. For example, a 4 credit hour course requires a minimum of 8 hours of out-of-class work.</p>

        <p>For graduate courses and upper-division courses, you should raise this expectation significantly. For example, a 4 credit hour graduate course will often take an average of 10 to 20 hours of outside work. Taking 3 graduate courses at once could result in anywhere between 30 to 60 hours of outside work!</p>

        <p>See the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/uploadedFiles/Destinations/Offices_and_Services/Provost/docs/USF%20Credit%20Hour%20Policy(1).pdf">Credit Hour Policy</a> for details on the minimum number of out-of-class hours for a course.</p>

 How do I register for graduate courses?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>You may register for graduate courses online in USF Connect. See <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/registration/onlineregistration/">this page</a> for instructions. If you run into any holds that prevent you from registering for graduate courses, please <a href="#contact">contact the graduate advisor</a>.</p>

    <dt><a name="registration_undergrad" class="badge" href="#registration_undergrad">Q</a>&nbsp;
 How do I register for undergraduate courses?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Since most of our undergraduate courses have prerequisite requirements, you will be unable to register for these courses the same way as graduate courses. There are two options for registering for undergraduate courses:

            <ol>
                <li><p>You can contact the instructor of the class and ask to have your prerequisite requirement waived in USF Connect. Make sure you include your CWID/student ID number. The instructor can waive the prerequisite by logging into Banner, clicking the "Faculty Services" tab, and selecting "Registration Overrides".</p>

                <p><strong class="text-danger">You must still enroll in the course.</strong> This process only waives the prerequisite requirement in the system, and does not actually register you in the course. Once the instructor confirms the requirement has been waived, you must still register for the course in USF Connect (see above).</p></li>

                <li><p>You may fill out an <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/onestopforms/">Registration Add/Drop Form</a> (under the "Records and Registration" category). You must get the graduate advisor to sign the form, and then drop it off at the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/onestop/">One Stop</a> office.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <p class="text-muted">Note that if you attempt to register for a course after the first week of class, you will need additional signatures to complete the registration process.</p>

The <strong>only</strong> exception is CS 490 Senior Team Project and CS 690 Master's Project.

 How do I know if I have foundational requirements?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Foundational requirements are included on your offer letter. If you are unable to find your offer letter, please <a href="#contact">contact the graduate advisor</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    
    <dt><a name="foundational_start" class="badge" href="#foundational_start">Q</a>&nbsp;
 When should I start satisfying my foundational requirements?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>You should start satisfying your foundational requirements right away, as you generally need the skills taught in these courses for the other graduate-level courses. However, many foundational courses (except for CS 212 Software Development) may be full by the time you arrive at USF. As such, most students start taking foundational requirements during their second semester.</p>
    </dd>

    
    <dt><a name="foundational_before" class="badge" href="#foundational_before">Q</a>&nbsp;
 Can I start fulfilling my foundational requirements before I officially start as a graduate student in the program?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Yes, you may enroll at USF as a visiting student. This will allow you to sign up for courses to fulfill your foundational requirements before you are officially accepted to the program. See <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/registration/visiting/">http://www.usfca.edu/registration/visiting/</a> for more information.</p>
    </dd>

    
    <dt><a name="foundational_electives" class="badge" href="#foundational_electives">Q</a>&nbsp;
 How many foundational requirements may be used as electives?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Only 2 foundational requirements may be used as electives. For example, if you have 4 foundational requirements, only 2 of those courses may be counted as electives. As such, you may need additional time to complete the Master's degree.</p>
    </dd>

    
    <dt><a name="foundational_usf" class="badge" href="#foundational_usf">Q</a>&nbsp;
 Do foundational requirements need to be taken at USF?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>No, you may take these requirements at another <em>reputable</em> university (not a community college) if you wish. Please <a href="#contact">contact the graduate advisor</a> to get approval <strong>BEFORE</strong> enrolling in courses at another institution.</p>

        <p>You will need to submit an official transcript from this institution before your foundational requirement will be waived. As such, many online courses will not fulfill these requirements.</p>
    </dd>

    
    <dt><a name="foundational_test" class="badge" href="#foundational_test">Q</a>&nbsp;
 Can I test out of the foundational requirements?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>No, for the most part you may not test out of the foundational requirements. The only exception is CS 212 Software Development.</p>
    </dd>

    
    <dt><a name="foundational_core" class="badge" href="#foundational_core">Q</a>&nbsp;
 Does CS 652 Programming Languages count for both a foundational requirement and a core course?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>No, you may not use this course to fulfill both requirements. If you take CS 652 to fulfill your foundational requirement, you may not also use it to fulfill a core requirement. However, you may use up to two foundational courses as electives.</p>
    </dd>


    
    <dt><a name="foundational_english" class="badge" href="#foundational_english">Q</a>&nbsp;
 What do I do if I have an English course requirement?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>You must take 4 units of English as a Second Language (ESL) courses. Generally, you can take these courses in addition to two CS courses. See the <a href="http://usfca.edu/esl/">ESL Department</a> for a list of courses.</p>
    </dd>
