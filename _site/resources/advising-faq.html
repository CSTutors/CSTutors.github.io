<h2>General Questions</h2>

<dl>

    <dt>Who is my advisor?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>The name of your official advisor can be found on USF Connect. You may also make an appointment to with any other faculty member in the computer science department to discuss your degree program. If you are a computer science minor or have not yet declared a major in computer science you are strongly encouraged to meet with an advisor.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>When should I see my advisor?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>You should meet with an advisor at least once per semester. This will ensure that you are on track to complete all of your degree requirements in a timely manner. Your advisor will also be happy to discuss internships and career objectives. Take advantage of the help your advisor can provide! He or she is not just there to remove your advising hold.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I make an appointment with my advisor?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>In the weeks before and during registration you may visit the computer science office in Harney 545 where Rosa Maria can set up an advising appointment. At any other time you may contact your advisor directly to set up an appointment. Also remember that you can visit a faculty member's office hours to discuss advising questions.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>What should I do to prepare for the meeting with my advisor?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>If you are meeting with your advisor to discuss course registration, before the meeting you should think carefully about which classes you would like to take. Come prepared with a list of potential classes and any questions you may have about which classes will be most helpful.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Which classes should I take?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/artsci/cs/curriculum/">Typical Curriculum</a> provides a good starting point in thinking about which classes you should be taking and when. Most computer science courses must be taken in a fairly strict sequence and so there are not many options for the major courses. It is a good idea to get your CORE requirements out of the way as early as possible. As you advance through the computer science program you will have less time in your schedule for non-computer science courses.</p>
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Transfer Students</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>How many credits must I complete at USF?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Transfer students must complete a minimum of 45 semester credits at USF. This is roughly 11 courses. In addition, students must complete their last 30 credit hours at USF. Please see the following URLs for more information: <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/admission/undergraduate/transfer/faq/">Transfer FAQ</a> and <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/student/">Catalog: Undergraduate Student Regulations</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How many computer science courses must I take at USF?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>For computer science majors, the Academic Residency Requirement requires that all students satisfactorily complete a minimum of 16 upper division credit hours in their major at USF. It is rare for a transfer student majoring in computer science to complete all major requirements and general education requirements in fewer than two years. See: <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/student/">Catalog: Undergraduate Student Regulations</a>.</p>

        <p>For computer science minors, at least one half of the minor credits must be taken at USF. Because USF requires five courses for the minor, typically at least three courses are taken at USF. See: <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/student/">Catalog: Undergraduate Student Regulations</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Which CORE classes can I transfer?</dt>

    <dd>
        <p>Contact the transfer office to find out which CORE requirements are met with transfer credits. The Transfer Center in the Office of Admission can be reached at (415) 422-4505.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Which computer science classes can I transfer?</dt>

    <dd>The Transfer Office will determine how many general credits you receive for computer science classes taken elsewhere. Contact the chair of the computer science department to discuss whether any of your computer science requirements are fulfilled with transfer credits. Be prepared to provide syllabi from classes you think may meet a USF computer science requirement, and also be prepared to discuss the material and assignments from the class with the professor of the equivalent course at USF.</dd>
