    <h4 class="media-heading">Wilson Giese</h4>

    <p>Hello computer science students! My name is Wilson Giese and I'll be one of your tutors this semester. I'm originally from a small town in Idaho, but at a young age I moved to the Bay Area and have been here ever since. In my free time I like to play video games, read books, and find various things to do around San Francisco. I chose to major in computer science after taking a computer science course in high school where I fell in love with the subject. As a tutor, I hope to help you further understand the subject matter, but I'm also always willing to discuss non-course related topics, so please don't hesitate to stop by!</p>

    <h4 class="media-heading">Michael Murphy</h4>

    <p>Hello! I'm Michael Murphy, a current Senior at USF, and I'm from Pasadena, California. I'm a pretty avid gamer and am a fan of a variety of books, movies, and television series. Before college I had never taken a Computer Science class in my life, but when I arrived Freshman year and had to pick classes I thought taking a programming class to fulfill my Math requirement would be more interesting than taking an actual Math class. I was actually pretty terrible at CS in the beginning, but I enjoyed the challenge and stuck with it. I learned a lot from each mistake I made along the way (and believe me, there were a lot of them) and I learned even more from the professors, TAs, and tutors who were always willing to take their time to help me out with whatever problem I was having, big or small. And now that I'm part of the CS Tutoring Center, I'm hoping to do the same. So if you are confused or stuck on anything (It happens to everyone, so don't be embarrassed. I can guarantee I've made much sillier ones) come see me and I'll help you out as much as I'm able to.</p>

    <h4 class="media-heading">Alyssa Pohahau</h4>

    <p>My name is Alyssa. I'm majoring in CS and minoring in Math. I currently help out with ACM and Women in CS. In the past, I interned at Rdio and Coderwall. I grew up in Santa Clara and have always been surrounded by computers and big tech companies. However, I was never seriously into computers as a kid. I wanted to declare a major when I was applying to colleges, so I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was good at and what kind of life/career I wanted after college. I played saxophone, but didn't love it enough to study music. I loved math, but I couldn't see myself having a career in it. After countless conversations with numerous people, I took advice from a close family friend and gave thought to CS. It seemed like a pretty ideal major: it's technical, I would be able to live in the Bay Area after college and it's an ever growing field. I declared it somewhat blindly, as I did not know exactly what it entailed, but I fell in love with it after my first semester. Besides computers, I'm into jazz, architecture, operas, going to museums and exploring the city. In addition to answering questions about assignments in my office hours, I'd be more than happy to chat about studying CS, resources to learn more about a specific field in CS (meetup groups/ online courses), or a common hobby we may have!</p>

    <h4 class="media-heading">Kevin Porter</h4>

    <p>My name is Kevin Porter. I grew up in San Diego playing soccer before coming to USF where I found a new passion in computer science. My passion for computer science stems from the fact that when you are done working on a computer science project you generally have something that you can use. This, to me, makes every computer science project interesting because you are working toward a finished product that does something rather than a paper or assignment that you will never look at again.</p>
