        <h4>Challenge 0: Programming Puzzle</h4>

        <p>Join us in CSI 307 for the programming challenge. All levels of computer science students are welcome&mdash;including beginners from CS 107 or CS 110!</p>

        <p>Check in with the challenge judge when you complete the puzzle. The judge will give you a special ticket that you will need at the finish line to win a prize.</p>

        <h4>Challenge 1: Photo Scavenger Hunt</h4>

        <p>The photo scavenger hunt requires you (or a team of up to 3 people) to take photos at different locations on CSI Level 1 and in the CSI Plaza. Check in with the challenge judge in the Discovery Lobby outside of CSI 103 for the specific list of photos required.</p>

        <p>We ask that you post these photos to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/tutoringcenter/">USF CS Tutoring Center Flickr Group</a>. You will need the <a href="http://mobile.yahoo.com/flickr/"><img src="http://l.yimg.com/g/images/goodies/white-small-chiclet.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"></a> <a href="http://mobile.yahoo.com/flickr/">Flickr App</a> installed on your smart phone for this part of the challenge. <span class="text-muted">(If you do not have a smart phone or Flickr account, it is okay to save photos to your phone or camera instead.)</span></p>

        <p>When done with the scavenger hunt, show your photos to the challenge judge in the Discovery Lobby just outside of CSI 103 to receive your ticket.</p>

        <h4>Challenge 2: Whiteboard Puzzle</h4>

        <p>For this challenge, there will be a puzzle written on the whiteboard in CSI 210 that you must solve. This puzzle will be designed to only require a bit of brainpower.</p>

        <p>When you figure out the answer, check in with the challenge judge to receive your ticket.</p>

        <h4>Challenge 3: Leave a Message</h4>

        <p>
            <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="{{ site.url }}/img/interactionarea.jpg" width="400">
        </p>

        <p>For this challenge, you need to stop by the Interaction Area next to CSI 307 and leave the CS Tutoring Center a message on the whiteboard. The challenge judge will be there with dry erase markers, and will give you the final challenge ticket when you are done!</p>

        <h4>Challenge Finish Line</h4>

        <p>When you are finished with all challenges, check in with the final challenge judge in CSI 307. The first 10 students that check in with all four challenge tickets will get their pick of prizes. See below for details.</p>

        <h2>Prizes</h2>

        <p>The first 10 students to complete all of the challenges will get to choose from the following prizes:</p>
