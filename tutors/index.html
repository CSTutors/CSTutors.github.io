	    <p>
I'm Scott, a senior CS major and music minor, born and raised in
Phoenix, AZ. I got hooked into computer science after taking CS110
with Professor Benson, and the rest is history. My interests in the
field are primarily game and graphics programming, and eventually I
want to study the common ground between artificial intelligence and
neuroscience. I love helping people learn, so never hesitate to ask me
any and all questions if you see me around!

            <h4 class="media-heading">Wilson Giese</h4>

            <p>Hello computer science students! My name is Wilson Giese and I'll be one of your tutors this semester. I'm originally from a small town in Idaho, but at a young age I moved to the Bay Area and have been here ever since. In my free time I like to play video games, read books, and find various things to do around San Francisco. I chose to major in computer science after taking a computer science course in high school where I fell in love with the subject. As a tutor, I hope to help you further understand the subject matter, but I'm also always willing to discuss non-course related topics, so please don't hesitate to stop by!</p>

            <h4 class="media-heading">Diana Ly</h4>

            <p>I am an incoming junior majoring in computer science and minoring in neuroscience. I have experience with Python, Java, and HTML/CSS as well as working knowledge of ROS and Ruby. The reason why I came to like computer science is that I enjoy the challenges programming can present, how its analogous to solving puzzles, and how broad CS is; it can be involved in any field such as healthcare, marketing, entertainment, and so forth which gives it the flexibility I like.</p>

            <h4 class="media-heading">Michael Murphy</h4>

            <p>Hello! I'm Michael Murphy, a current Senior at USF, and I'm from Pasadena, California. I'm a pretty avid gamer and am a fan of a variety of books, movies, and television series. Before college I had never taken a Computer Science class in my life, but when I arrived Freshman year and had to pick classes I thought taking a programming class to fulfill my Math requirement would be more interesting than taking an actual Math class. I was actually pretty terrible at CS in the beginning, but I enjoyed the challenge and stuck with it. I learned a lot from each mistake I made along the way (and believe me, there were a lot of them) and I learned even more from the professors, TAs, and tutors who were always willing to take their time to help me out with whatever problem I was having, big or small. And now that I'm part of the CS Tutoring Center, I'm hoping to do the same. So if you are confused or stuck on anything (It happens to everyone, so don't be embarrassed. I can guarantee I've made much sillier ones) come see me and I'll help you out as much as I'm able to.</p>

            <h4 class="media-heading">Kevin Porter</h4>

            <p>My name is Kevin Porter. I grew up in San Diego playing soccer before coming to USF where I found a new passion in computer science. My passion for computer science stems from the fact that when you are done working on a computer science project you generally have something that you can use. This, to me, makes every computer science project interesting because you are working toward a finished product that does something rather than a paper or assignment that you will never look at again.</p>

            <p>Chris is a recent graduate from the Web Science Master's program. He works for an independent Internet service provider on both front and back end applications, using C++, Java and PHP on a daily basis.  In addition to tutoring, he will be coordinating tutors and CS events.</p>
