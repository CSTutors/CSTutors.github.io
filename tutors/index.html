	    <p>
            Hello everyone! My name is Diana and I'm from San Jose, California. I'm a senior, majoring in CS and minoring in neuroscience. The reason why I came to like computer science is that I enjoy the challenges it can present and how it can be applied to practically every field. My hobbies are playing video games, going on food adventures, and immersing myself in the world of anime and manga. I also enjoy helping others so feel free to ask me any questions.

            <p>Hey that picture above this is me, Mitchel Hally. I'm a senior undergraduate Computer Science major here at USF with a passion for teaching and helping others succeed. I'm originally from Boston, MA, where I found my love for computers messing around with the only ones I could find at the public library. My favorite languages now are Python and C, but I'll never forget all those good times I had error handling in Java. As you can imagine, I like to play video games (shockerrrrr) and I'm a bit of a music geek. Anything else you want to know, just come up and ask! :)</p>
