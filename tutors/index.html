            <h4 class="media-heading">Michael Murphy</h4>

            <p>Hello! I'm Michael Murphy, a current Senior at USF, and I'm from Pasadena, California. I'm a pretty avid gamer and am a fan of a variety of books, movies, and television series. Before college I had never taken a Computer Science class in my life, but when I arrived Freshman year and had to pick classes I thought taking a programming class to fulfill my Math requirement would be more interesting than taking an actual Math class. I was actually pretty terrible at CS in the beginning, but I enjoyed the challenge and stuck with it. I learned a lot from each mistake I made along the way (and believe me, there were a lot of them) and I learned even more from the professors, TAs, and tutors who were always willing to take their time to help me out with whatever problem I was having, big or small. And now that I'm part of the CS Tutoring Center, I'm hoping to do the same. So if you are confused or stuck on anything (It happens to everyone, so don't be embarrassed. I can guarantee I've made much sillier ones) come see me and I'll help you out as much as I'm able to.</p>

	    <p>
	Hello everyone! My name is Diana and I'm from San Jose, California. I'm a senior, majoring in CS and minoring in neuroscience. The reason why I came to like computer science is that I enjoy the challenges it can present and how it can be applied to practically every field. My hobbies are playing video games, going on food adventures, and immersing myself in the world of anime and manga. I also enjoy helping others so feel free to ask me any questions. </p>

	    <p>Hi! My name is Milica. I am from Belgrade, Serbia. I am a junior majoring in Math and Computer Science. I always loved math and thought that CS is a great implementation of it and that's how I got involved in CS. I play tennis here at USF. We would greatly appreciate fans coming to our games! In my free time I enjoy running, reading, music (I am in voices and there are fun concerts at the end of each semester. Everyone is welcome to come and enjoy!)... Feel free to come by whenever you are around!
