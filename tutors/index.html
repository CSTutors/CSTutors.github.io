            <p>Professor David Wolber launched the CS Tutoring Center in Spring 2013. He is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/App-Inventor-Create-Your-Android/dp/1449397484">App Inventor: Create Your Own Android Apps</a> along with Hal Abelson, Ellen Spertus and Liz Looney from the App Inventor team, runs <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/">AppInventor.org</a> which provides on-line, video-based teaching lessons, and teaches App Inventor in his <a href="http://appinventorintro.com/">CS 107 Computing, Mobile Apps, and the Web</a> course. David began teaching App Inventor as part of Google's 2009 pilot program involving ten universities. In 2010, he received a grant from Google to work with the App Inventor team and authored the <a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/learn/tutorials/index.html">advanced tutorials</a> that appear on the App Inventor site.</p>

      <p>
      Mehmet Emre teaches CS 345, CS 414, and CS 411 at USF.  Mehmet's research
      is at the intersection of programming languages and software
      engineering. His focus is on building and using program analyses to
      understand the behavior of programs automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
      His ongoing research projects include automatically giving students hints
      when their programs don't work, extracting memory and thread safety
      properties in C programs, accelerating automatic test generation by
      removing pruning irrelevant tests, embeddeded logic programming
      runtimes. He has also worked on research projects involving dynamic
      invariant inference, finding similar snippets between programs, and
      debugging/understanding program analyses.
