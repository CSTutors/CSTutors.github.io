  <h2>Account Basics</h2>

  <p>Your CS account shares the same username as your USF Connect account, but <em>different</em> passwords. You should use your CS account for the following purposes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Logging into the computers in the Kudlick classroom, located in Harney Science Center room 235.</p></li>

    <li><p>Logging into the computers in the Computer Science lab, located in Harney Science Center room 530.</p></li>

    <li><p>Logging into the lab computers remotely.</p></li>

    <li><p>Accessing your Subversion (SVN) code repository.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alternatively, you use your USF Connect username and password to login to USF Connect and access your @dons.usfca.edu email and other university-wide resources.</p>

  <h2>Logging In</h2>

  <p>Your initial password will be the <b>LAST</b> six digits of your student ID. Since your student ID is 8 digits, remove the first two digits from your student ID (usually 20) and use the remaining digits as your password. For example, if your student ID is <code>20123456</code>, then your initial password will be <code>123456</code>.</p>

  <p>You should change your password after logging in for the first time. You can do this by opening a Terminal window and entering <code>passwd</code> at the command line <em class="muted">(note the spelling)</em>. Follow the prompts to choose a new password.</p>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <p>When you register for a computer science class, a CS account will be automatically created for you. However, if you registered late it is possible an account has not yet been setup.</p>

  <p>If you are having trouble logging in, there is a simple test to determine if you have an account. Try entering the following link into your web browser, replacing <code>test</code> with your CS username:</p>

  <pre>http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~test</pre>

  <p>If you have an account setup, you should see something like this:</p>
