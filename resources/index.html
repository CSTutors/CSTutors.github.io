<h3>Please check out <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/computer-science/technical-resources">USFCS Support FAQ</a> for technical resources.</h3>

<p>The university also provides support and resources. For example, check out the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/casa/">Center for Academic and Student Achievement (CASA)</a>, the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/lwc/">Learning and Writing Center (LWC)</a>, <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/sds/">Student Disability Services (SDS)</a>, and <a href="http://usfca.edu/its/help/students/">ITS Student Services</a>.</p>

<p>There are many additional resources on the web. In particular, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions">StackOverflow</a> is a great place to ask questions and see responses. However, you should double-check the <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity">academic honesty policy</a> for your course before using any web-based resources. And, whenever referencing or using material that is not your own, make sure you properly cite your sources!</p>
