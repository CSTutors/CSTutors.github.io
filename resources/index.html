<p>The CS Tutoring Center holds several workshops throughout the semester. You can find the workshop schedule on the <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a>, and the associated workshop materials below.</p>

</ul>

<p>You will also find the resources below helpful. You can also <a href="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/basics.html">go to this website</a> for other basic tutorials. If you have any questions, contacting <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/support.html">CS Support</a> is always a good first step towards getting answers.</p>

<h2>Working From Home</h2>

<p>Many classes require you to test code on the lab computers. However, you can still work from home and connect remotely to these computers for testing purposes as needed. The following guides will help get you started working remotely:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-20-logging-in-remotely %}">Logging in Remotely</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-01-01-logging-in-without-a-password %}">Logging in Without a Password</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-21-transferring-files %}">Transferring Files</a></li>
    <li style="margin-top: 1ex;"><a href="{% post_url 2013-01-01-using-linux-via-command-line %}">Using Linux via Command Line</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-01-01-using-java-via-command-line %}">Using Java via Command Line</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You  may also be able to acquire a virtual image that matches the lab computers, and run this image in a free emulator (like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>) on your own system. If you are interested in this option, please contact your instructor or <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/support.html">CS Support</a>.</p>

<h2>Walkthroughs</h2>

<p>Eventually, the <a href="http://sjengle.cs.usfca.edu/resources">Getting Started Guides</a> will be migrated here. In the meantime, please visit that website for additional walkthroughs.</p>

<p>The university also provides support and resources.

<p>There are many additional resources on the web. In particular, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions">StackOverflow</a> is a great place to ask questions and see responses. However, you should double-check the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/policies/honor">academic honesty policy</a> for your course before using any web-based resources. And, whenever referencing or using material that is not your own, make sure you properly cite your sources!</p>
