<p>In addition to the resources here, you may also want to check out the <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/support.html">USFCS Support FAQ</a>, the <a href="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/basics.html">USFCS Resources</a> page, or the <a href="http://sjengle.cs.usfca.edu/resources">Getting Started Guides</a> for other department-specific resources.</p>

<p>The university also provides support and resources. For example, check out the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/casa/">Center for Academic and Student Achievement (CASA)</a>, the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/lwc/">Learning and Writing Center (LWC)</a>, <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/sds/">Student Disability Services (SDS)</a>, and <a href="http://usfca.edu/its/help/students/">ITS Student Services</a>.</p>

<p>There are many additional resources on the web. In particular, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions">StackOverflow</a> is a great place to ask questions and see responses. However, you should double-check the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/policies/honor">academic honesty policy</a> for your course before using any web-based resources. And, whenever referencing or using material that is not your own, make sure you properly cite your sources!</p>
