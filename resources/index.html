<h2>Workshops</h2>

<p>The CS Tutoring Center holds several workshops throughout the semester. You can find the workshop schedule on the <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a>, and the associated workshop materials below.</p>

<ul>
    <li>2013-02-11: GitHub Workshop [<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cEanHv4klTTpqGZeDMzBa3vTpNE7PCHlBZrvVd2w5So/edit?hl=en&pli=1#slide=id.p">slides</a>]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you are new to the program, welcome! There are a few things you should know to get started in the program:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-18-advising-faq %}">Advising FAQ</a></li>

    <li style="margin-top: 1ex;"><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-02-about-cs-accounts %}">About CS Accounts</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-20-email-forwarding %}">Email Forwarding</a></li>

    <li style="margin-top: 1ex;"><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-20-getting-help %}">Getting Help</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You will also find the resources below helpful. You can also <a href="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/basics.html">go to this website</a> for other basic tutorials. If you have any questions, contacting <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/support.html">CS Support</a> is always a good first step towards getting answers.</p>

<h2>Working From Home</h2>

<p>Many classes require you to test code on the lab computers. However, you can still work from home and connect remotely to these computers for testing purposes as needed. The following guides will help get you started working remotely:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-20-logging-in-remotely %}">Logging in Remotely</a></li>
    <li><a class="muted">Logging in Without a Password</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-21-transferring-files %}">Transferring Files</a></li>

    <li style="margin-top: 1ex;"><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-31-using-linux-via-command-line %}">Using Linux via Command Line</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-08-01-using-java-via-command-line %}">Using Java via Command Line</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You  may also be able to acquire a virtual image that matches the lab computers, and run this image in a free emulator (like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>) on your own system. If you are interested in this option, please contact your instructor or <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/support.html">CS Support</a>.</p>

<h2>Using Revision Control</h2>

<p>You should eventually get used to using a revision control system. The department supports Subversion (SVN), and is beginning to also support Git. The following guides will help you get started using SVN:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-31-why-use-revision-control %}">Why Use Revision Control?</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-31-subversion-svn-basics %}">Subversion (SVN) Basics</a></li>

    <li style="margin-top: 1ex;"><a href="{% post_url 2013-08-01-using-svn-via-command-line %}">Using SVN via Command Line</a></li>
    <li><a class="muted">Using SVN via Eclipse and Subclipse</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional guides on using Git will be added as the environment stabilizes and more courses start using it instead of SVN. In the meantime, if you are interested in Git, you may want to sign up for a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. It is a good way to establish a professional presence on the web, but you do need to be careful not to publicly share code solutions to homework. Otherwise, you risk being accused of cheating.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Eclipse</h2>

<p>It is important you become familiar with using the command line to write and run code, but eventually you may want to move to using a integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse. (This is a requirement in some classes.) The following guides will tell you how to get Eclipse setup with Java and Subversion:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a class="muted">Setting Up Java and Eclipse</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% post_url 2013-07-31-configuring-eclipse %}">Configuring Eclipse</a></li>

    <li style="margin-top: 1ex;"><a class="muted">Using SVN via Eclipse and Subclipse</a></li>
    <li><a class="muted">Enabling Assertions in Eclipse</a></li>
    <li><a class="muted">Adding User Libraries in Eclipse</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Eclipse will always be available on the lab computers as well. When you combine Eclipse and SVN, you can have a very smooth transition between working on the lab computers and working from home.</p>

<p>You can also use Eclipse with Python and Git. If you are interested, there are plenty of resources on the web.</p>

<h2>Creating a Website</h2>

<p>Having a professional web presence is important in today's job market. You have two options for setting up your own website to advertise your accomplishments and projects while at the University of San Francisco:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a class="muted">Creating a CS Website</a></li>
    <li><a class="muted">Creating a Google Site</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The first option requires you to write your own website code, but basic HTML and CSS should be easy for a computer science major to pick up. The second option, creating a Google Site, requires no prior knowledge with web coding and may be easier to maintain.</p>

<p>In either case, remember to focus on creating a <em>professional</em> web presence. You may also want to setup a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account that focuses on your professional accomplishments.</p>

<h2>Walkthroughs</h2>

<p>Eventually, the <a href="http://sjengle.cs.usfca.edu/resources">Getting Started Guides</a> will be migrated here. In the meantime, please visit that website for additional walkthroughs.</p>

<h2>Additional</h2>

<p>In addition to the resources here, you may also want to check out the <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/support.html">USFCS Support FAQ</a>, the <a href="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/basics.html">USFCS Resources</a> page, or the <a href="http://sjengle.cs.usfca.edu/resources">Getting Started Guides</a> for other department-specific resources.</p>

<p>The university also provides support and resources. For example, check out the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/casa/">Center for Academic and Student Achievement (CASA)</a>, the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/lwc/">Learning and Writing Center (LWC)</a>, <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/sds/">Student Disability Services (SDS)</a>, and <a href="http://usfca.edu/its/help/students/">ITS Student Services</a>.</p>

<p>There are many additional resources on the web. In particular, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions">StackOverflow</a> is a great place to ask questions and see responses. However, you should double-check the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/policies/honor">academic honesty policy</a> for your course before using any web-based resources. And, whenever referencing or using material that is not your own, make sure you properly cite your sources!</p>
